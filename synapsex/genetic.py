"""Simple genetic algorithm for ANN hyper-parameter search.

This module provides a light‑weight genetic algorithm that searches over a
small space of ``HyperParameters`` in order to maximise the F1 score of a
``PyTorchANN`` model.  It is intentionally minimal and dependency free so it
can run in constrained environments.

The search space currently covers the dropout rate, learning rate and structural
parameters such as the number of transformer layers and attention heads.  These
choices strongly influence classification metrics like accuracy, recall and
precision.  Each individual in the population represents a unique combination of
these parameters.  Individuals are evaluated by training a model for a few
epochs and scoring it on a held‑out validation set.  The best performing network
and its parameters are returned so the strongest candidate is not lost to random
re‑initialisation.

The algorithm is purposely small so that projects can quickly experiment with
genetic optimisation without pulling in heavy third‑party libraries.
